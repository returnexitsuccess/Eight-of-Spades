Eight of Spades
===============

Intro
===============
Eight of Spades is a card game created by my friends on a houseboat trip in Summer 2013. The game was mainly created as a joke to pretend that skill is required in a game of chance. The game soon evolved into 20-30 guys crowding around a handful actually playing the game, all being as loud as possible and chanting eight of spades. While on the houseboat trip, I realized that the expected value is rather easy to analyze for each choice on any given turn, so that's what I did. I sat down with a sharpie and construction paper (all that was available) and wrote out the expected value equations for each choice. This would become the base for which the Hard AI and the rest of this game is based on.

Rules
===============
The 52 cards that are part of a standard deck of cards are first shuffled and then laid out face down in a 7x7 grid. The last 3 cards are then arranged in a triangle next to the the grid. The triangle is amusingly referred to as the illuminati. The game proceeds by having a player start his or her turn by saying one of the four suits or "Eight of Spades" and then flipping over a card. If the card matches what the player has said, then they get to keep that card and every other face-up card, if it doesn't then they leave the card face-up in the grid. If the player has called Spades but flips over the Eight of Spades, despite the card matching they do not get to keep it and leave the card face-up in the grid. Each normal card is worth 1 point and the Eight of Spades can take on various high point values depending on the style of play. The standard point value for the Eight of Spades is 52 divided by the number of players, rounded up. After flipping over a card and either collecting the cards or leaving it face-up, the player's turn is over and the game continues clockwise around the table. The three illuminati cards act like the normal grid but are worth ten points. However, they can only be flipped over if a player first gambles 5 points that he or she had already won in previous rounds. Additionally, if the Eight of Spades is called in the illuminati and flipped over, then that player automatically wins the entire game.

Those are the basic rules you need to know in order to get a feel for how the game is played. There are further rules that are necessary for play. The first is the importance of the Ace of Spades. If flipped over at any time, the Ace of Spades causes the player that flipped it over to lose all the points they currently have. If the Ace of Spades is flipped in the illuminati, the player will be removed from the game and play will continue without that player. The second additional rule is called "locking". If two flipped-up cards in the grid that are adjacent to each other are the same suit, then they become "locked". What this means is that a player can only collect these cards if they called and flipped over a card of that same suit. Example: If a two of hearts and a nine of hearts are flipped up next to each other in the grid then they will become locked, dentoed visually by making the adjoining edge of the cards touch. If a player then later calls spades and flips over a seven of spades, then they will collect all the face-up cards on the table, but leave the two locked hearts.

The game ends when all cards have been flipped over or when the Eight of Spades has been called and flipped over in the illuminati. The winner is either the one who has the most points or the one who called the Eight of Spades, respectively.
